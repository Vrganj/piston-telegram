# piston-telegram
A Telegram bot for Piston

(NOTE: I wrote it quickly. It breaks often, though it will be fixed)
## Running it
Create a bot following https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot

After that, you can compile and run it:
```bash
go build .
TOKEN=(your bot token) ./piston-telegram
```
